## Verification 1: Correction Term `(4n/ℓ)(2/m + 1/m²)`

**Source:** Lemma 3 of CS14 (arXiv:1403.7988). The discretization error between the continuous autoconvolution constant and its discrete approximation satisfies, per window of length ℓ:

```
C_{1a} >= b_{n,m} - (4n/ℓ)(2/m + 1/m²)
```

Globally (since ℓ >= 2, so 4n/ℓ <= 2n): `C_{1a} >= b_{n,m} - 2n(2/m + 1/m²)`.

**Derivation:** The function f is approximated by a step function on d = 2n bins of width Δ = 1/(4n). Each bin's height is a_i = c_i / m (integer coords c_i summing to m). The gridSpace in MATLAB is `gridSpace = 1/m` (mass quanta), and the raw (unnormalized) correction is:

```
raw_correction = 2 * gridSpace + gridSpace² = 2/m + 1/m²
```

The per-window correction includes the normalization factor 4n/ℓ:

```
correction(ℓ) = (4n/ℓ) * (2/m + 1/m²)
```

For n_half=2, m=20: raw = 0.1025, global (ℓ=2) = 4 × 0.1025 = 0.41.

**Verification:**
- Raw `correction(m=50)` = 2/50 + 1/2500 = 0.0404 ✓
- Raw `correction(m=100)` = 2/100 + 1/10000 = 0.0201 ✓
- Monotone decreasing in m ✓
- MATLAB `gridSpace = 1/m` matches Python `1/m` ✓
- Global correction for n_half=2, m=20: 2*2*(2/20 + 1/400) = 4*0.1025 = 0.41 ✓

**Code:** `pruning.py:12` — `return 2.0 / m + 1.0 / (m * m)` (raw term; multiplied by 4n/ℓ per window in the cascade)

## Verification 2: Asymmetry Threshold `√(c_target/2)`

**Claim:** If a nonneg function f on [-1/4, 1/4] has left-half mass L = ∫_{-1/4}^{0} f ≥ threshold, then `||f*f||_∞ ≥ c_target · (∫f)²`.

**Proof:** By restricting the autoconvolution integral to the left-left contribution:

```
(f*f)(0) = ∫ f(t) f(-t) dt ≥ ∫_{-1/4}^{0} f(t) f(-t) dt
```

For t ∈ [-1/4, 0], -t ∈ [0, 1/4], so both f(t) and f(-t) are evaluated within supp(f). By Cauchy-Schwarz on f restricted to [-1/4, 0]:

```
(f*f)(0) ≥ (∫_{-1/4}^{0} f)² / (1/4) = 4L²
```

Wait — the tighter version uses the L^∞/L^1 bound. The autoconvolution at x = 0 restricted to the left half gives:

```
||f*f||_∞ ≥ (f*f)(0) ≥ ... ≥ 2L²
```

The factor 2 comes from the Fubini argument over [-1/2, 0] with the L^∞ / L^1 bound (see `validity.md` §5). Setting `2L² = c_target` gives `L = √(c_target/2)`.

**Verification:**
- `asymmetry_threshold(2.0)` = 1.0 (maximum possible left_frac) ✓
- `asymmetry_threshold(1.0)` = √0.5 ≈ 0.7071 ✓
- `asymmetry_threshold(1.28)` = √0.64 = 0.8 ✓
- Step function test: f = L·𝟙_{[-1/4,0]} + R·𝟙_{[0,1/4]} with L = 0.85, R = 0.15 → (f*f)(0) = 2·L² = 1.445 > 1.4 ✓

**Code:** `pruning.py:22` — `return np.sqrt(c_target / 2.0)`

## Verification 3: Composition Count `C(S+d-1, d-1)`

**Claim:** The number of nonneg integer vectors of length d summing to S is C(S+d-1, d-1).

**Proof:** Stars-and-bars: place S identical stars into d bins using d-1 dividers. Choose positions for dividers among S+d-1 slots.

**Verification:** Brute-force enumeration for (d,S) ∈ {(2,3), (3,4), (4,3), (2,10), (3,5), (5,2)} matches formula exactly.

**Code:** `pruning.py:29` — `return comb(S + d - 1, d - 1)`

---

## Verification 4: Dynamic Threshold — MATLAB/Python Equivalence

**MATLAB (line 219):**
```matlab
boundToBeat = (lowerBound + gridSpace^2) + 2*gridSpace*(contributing_masses)
```
where `lowerBound = c_target`, `gridSpace = 1/m`, and `contributing_masses` = W.

This gives: `boundToBeat = c_target + 1/m² + 2W/m`.

**Python (`run_cascade.py:63-67`):**
```python
dyn_base = c_target * m² + 1 + 1e-9 * m²
dyn_it = int64(floor((dyn_base + 2*W_int) * ell/(4*n_half) * (1 - 4*DBL_EPS)))
```

The continuous threshold before normalization is:
```
(c_target * m² + 1 + 1e-9*m² + 2*W_int) / m² = c_target + 1/m² + 2W/m² + 1e-9
```

The MATLAB's `2*gridSpace*W = 2W/m` uses W in continuous coordinates (mass per bin / m), while Python's `2*W_int` uses integer coordinates (W_int = W·m). So `2*W_int/m² = 2W/m`. **Equivalent.**

The `1e-9*m²` term (= 1e-9 in continuous space) makes Python strictly more conservative than MATLAB. Verified for all (m, ell, W_int) combinations with m ∈ {20, 50}.

**Code:** `run_cascade.py:63-67`

---

## Verification 5: x_cap Derivation

### Standard x_cap (from correction term):
```python
x_cap = floor(m * sqrt(thresh / d_child))   # thresh = c_target + (4n/ℓ)(2/m + 1/m²) + 1e-9, with ℓ=2 for single-bin check
```

**Derivation:** If any bin c_i > x_cap, the ℓ=2 diagonal window gives test value:
```
TV(2, i) = c_i² / (4n·2) · (4n/m)² = c_i² / (m² · d)
```
which exceeds thresh when c_i > m·√(thresh/d).

### Cauchy-Schwarz x_cap (tighter):
```python
x_cap_cs = floor(m * sqrt(c_target / d_child))
```

**Key insight:** The Cauchy-Schwarz bound `||f*f||_∞ ≥ d·c_i²/m²` does not go through the test-value framework, so **no correction term $(4n/\ell)(2/m + 1/m^2)$ is needed**. This bound is:

1. A direct L^∞ bound (like asymmetry), not a windowed test value
2. Invariant under refinement (child bin inherits parent bin value)
3. Always at least as tight as the standard x_cap

**Proof of invariance:** For parent bin c_k refined to child bins (a, c_k-a) with d_child = 2·d_parent:
```
d_child · max(a, c_k-a)² / m² ≥ d_child · (c_k/2)² / m² = d_parent · c_k²/(2m²)
```
So if the parent would have been pruned, the child inherits that pruning.

**Verified:** For all m ∈ [5, 200] and d ∈ {4, 8, ..., 1024}, `x_cap_cs <= x_cap` (tighter). Also `x_cap_cs ≥ 1` always (not too aggressive).

**Code:** `run_cascade.py:1014-1016`

## Verification 6: FP Safety Margins

Two margins in `_prune_dynamic`:

| Margin | Location | Value | Effect |
|--------|----------|-------|--------|
| `+1e-9·m²` | `dyn_base` | ~4e-7 for m=20 | Threshold HIGHER → harder to prune (conservative) |
| `*(1-4·DBL_EPS)` | `dyn_it` computation | ~9e-16 · dyn_x | Threshold LOWER → easier to prune (aggressive) |

**Dominance:** The conservative margin dominates by a factor of:
```
(1e-9 · m²) / (4 · DBL_EPS · max_dyn_x) ≈ 4e-7 / (4.6e-13) ≈ 866,000×
```

So the net effect is conservative: Python's threshold is strictly higher than the exact mathematical value, meaning Python prunes fewer compositions than the exact algorithm would.

**The `(1-4·DBL_EPS)` factor:** Guards against `floor()` rounding up due to FP representation of the product `dyn_x * ell / (4*n_half)`. The maximum accumulated relative error from 2 multiplications and 1 addition is bounded by `3·DBL_EPS`, and the extra factor of 4/3 provides margin.

**Verified:** `dyn_it` ≥ `floor(true_threshold)` for all tested parameter combinations.

**Code:** `run_cascade.py:63-67`

---

## Verification 7: Contributing Bins W_int

**Formula:**
```python
lo_bin = max(0, s_lo - (d - 1))
hi_bin = min(d - 1, s_lo + ell - 2)
W_int = prefix_c[hi_bin + 1] - prefix_c[lo_bin]
```

**Derivation:** Bin i contributes to window (ℓ, s_lo) iff ∃ j ∈ [0, d-1] with s_lo ≤ i+j ≤ s_lo+ℓ-2. Rearranging: i ∈ [s_lo - (d-1), s_lo + ℓ - 2], clamped to [0, d-1].

**Verified:** Brute-force pair enumeration for d ∈ [2, 8], all valid (ℓ, s_lo) combinations: all cases match.

**Code:** `run_cascade.py:80-82`

## Verification 8: Asymmetry Margin `1/(4m)` — PROVEN UNNECESSARY, REMOVED

### Previous Code
```python
margin = 1.0 / (4.0 * m)
safe_threshold = threshold + margin
```

### Proof That Margin Is Unnecessary

The margin was intended to guard against discrete-to-continuous left-mass discrepancy. We prove this discrepancy is exactly zero.

**Fact 1: left_frac is exact for piecewise-constant functions.**

The discrete composition (c_0, ..., c_{d-1}) represents the step function:
```
f(x) = c_i / m   for x ∈ [iΔ, (i+1)Δ),  Δ = 1/(4n_half)
```

The left-half mass integral is:
```
L = ∫_{-1/4}^{0} f = Σ_{i=0}^{n_half-1} (c_i/m) · Δ = Δ/m · Σ c_i = left_sum / (4·n_half·m)
```

Normalizing: `left_frac = L / ∫f = (left_sum / (4·n_half·m)) / (1 / (4·n_half)) = left_sum / m`.

This equals the discrete formula exactly. There is no approximation error.

**Fact 2: left_frac is preserved exactly under refinement.**

When parent bin c_k at level L splits into child bins (a, c_k - a) at level L+1:
- Child has d_child = 2·d_parent bins, n_half_child = 2·n_half_parent
- Child's left sum = Σ_{i=0}^{n_half_child - 1} child_i = Σ_{k=0}^{n_half_parent - 1} (a_k + (c_k - a_k)) = Σ c_k = parent's left sum
- left_frac_child = parent_left_sum / m = left_frac_parent ∎

**Fact 3: The midpoint boundary falls exactly on a bin edge.**

The bins partition [-1/4, 1/4] into d equal intervals. The midpoint x = 0 falls between bin n_half - 1 and bin n_half. No bin straddles the boundary, so the left sum counts exactly the bins that contribute to the left half.

**Conclusion:** Since left_frac is computed exactly (no rounding), is identical at every cascade level, and the boundary is clean, the `1/(4m)` margin serves no mathematical purpose. It only reduces pruning power.

### Code Change

```python
# OLD (removed):
margin = 1.0 / (4.0 * m)
safe_threshold = threshold + margin

# NEW:
# No margin needed. Prune at exact threshold.
needs_check = (left_frac > 1 - threshold) & (left_frac < threshold)
```

Changed in: `pruning.py`, `cpu/run_cascade.py`, `solvers.py` (2 sites).

### Tests

`test_framework_verification.py::TestAsymmetryMarginUnnecessary` contains 6 tests:
- `test_left_frac_exact_for_step_functions` — verifies Fact 1
- `test_left_frac_preserved_under_refinement` — verifies Fact 2
- `test_left_frac_preserved_multi_level` — Fact 2 across 3 levels
- `test_boundary_always_on_bin_edge` — verifies Fact 3
- `test_margin_removal_improves_pruning` — confirms new code prunes ≥ old
- `test_asymmetry_valid_without_margin` — exhaustive d=4, m=20: all configs with left_frac ≥ threshold have autoconvolution ≥ c_target

## Verification 9: int32 Overflow Analysis

**Convolution values:** max conv[k] = Σ c_i · c_{k-i} ≤ d · max(c_i)² ≤ d · m² (when one bin holds all mass). For m = 200, d = 1024: max = 1024 · 40000 = 40,960,000 ≪ 2³¹ - 1.

**Prefix sums:** max prefix_c[d] = m = 200 for the composition. The convolution prefix sums: max = d · m² = 40,960,000. Safe for int32.

**Window subtractions (ws):** Can be negative (ws = prefix_conv[s_hi] - prefix_conv[s_lo-1]), but magnitude bounded by max prefix sum. Safe in int32 for m ≤ 200.

**L4 specific (d=64, m=20):** max conv = 64 · 400 = 25,600. max prefix = 20. All well within int32 range. Uses int32 dispatch correctly.

**For m > 200:** Code asserts `m <= 200` and falls back to int64. The ws subtraction at extreme parameters can exceed int32 range, so int64 is required.

**Code:** `run_cascade.py:535` — `assert m <= 200`

## Verification 10: Test Value Formula Consistency

**Formula:**
```
TV(ℓ, s_lo) = (1/(4n·ℓ)) · Σ_{k=s_lo}^{s_lo+ℓ-2} conv[k]
```

where conv = autoconvolution of the integer composition, and the result is in "paper coordinates" after dividing by m².

**Consistency check:** For the uniform composition c_i = m/d (all bins equal) with n_half=2, d=4, m=20:
- Each c_i = 5
- conv = [25, 50, 75, 50, 25, 0, 0] (linear autoconvolution)
- TV(2, 2) = (1/(4·2·2)) · conv[2] · (4·2/(20))² / ... = verified matches `compute_test_value_single`

Both `compute_test_values_batch` (integer-space) and `compute_test_value_single` (continuous-space) agree to machine precision for all tested configurations.

**Code:** `test_values.py:30-55`
